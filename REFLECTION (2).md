# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was often off in the beginning, as I tended to underestimate the time required for complex tasks. As I progressed through the course, I became more accurate, but there were still occasional surprises.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I gained more experience with the practicals and became more familiar with the types of tasks required, my estimate accuracy improved. I learned to better anticipate the challenges that might arise and to allocate more time for debugging and testing.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable parts and estimating each part individually. This approach helped me provide more accurate overall estimates. I also realized the value of including buffer time for unexpected issues.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned that code reviews are invaluable for catching mistakes that I might have missed. Reviewers often provided insights on best practices and helped me see my code from a different perspective, leading to improvements in code quality.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code taught me to be more critical of my own work. It also helped me understand common pitfalls and how to avoid them. Additionally, I learned how to give constructive feedback that can help others improve their coding skills.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Good Review 1](https://github.com/123yongzheng/CP1404-TR2/pull/6)

### Explanation

In this review, I focused on improving code readability and suggested more descriptive variable names. I also pointed out a potential issue with the logic that could cause a bug under certain conditions.

### Good Code Review 2

[Good Review 2]( https://github.com/TarshanVicknesan/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

This review emphasized the importance of following Pythonic conventions. I suggested a more efficient way to handle list operations and explained how it could improve the overall performance of the code.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge, I would include more real-world scenarios that integrate multiple concepts from different practicals. This would provide students with a more holistic understanding of how to apply their skills in real-life situations. Additionally, I would introduce more collaborative tasks to encourage peer learning.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently approached each practical with a focus on understanding the underlying concepts rather than just completing the tasks. This helped me to not only finish the practicals on time but also to retain the knowledge and apply it in different contexts. I also paid attention to writing clean, readable code and ensuring that my solutions were well-documented.
